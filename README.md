# Kalpesh_Zambare_Melanoma_Detection_Assignment
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

> This project involves the classification of skin cancer using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify skin images into different categories corresponding to different types of skin cancer.

The project follows the typical machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, model construction, training, and evaluation.

Here is a step-by-step description of the project:

Data Preparation: The project starts with collecting a dataset of skin images. The dataset contains images of different types of skin cancer. The images are organized into different classes based on the type of cancer. The dataset is split into a training set and a validation set.

Data Augmentation: To address the class imbalance issue and improve model performance, data augmentation is applied to the training dataset. Augmentor, a Python library, is used to generate additional training samples by applying random rotations, flips, and zooms to the images.

Model Construction: The CNN model is constructed using the Keras library. The model architecture consists of several convolutional layers with activation functions, max pooling layers, and a dropout layer for regularization. The model ends with a fully connected layer followed by a softmax activation function to output the probabilities of different classes.

Model Compilation: The model is compiled with an optimizer (Adam), a loss function (Sparse Categorical Crossentropy), and evaluation metrics (accuracy). This configuration specifies how the model will be trained and evaluated.

Model Training: The model is trained using the training dataset. The training process involves iterating over the dataset for a specified number of epochs. In each epoch, the model makes predictions on the training samples, compares them with the ground truth labels, and adjusts its parameters using backpropagation and gradient descent to minimize the loss.

Model Evaluation: After training, the model is evaluated using the validation dataset. The evaluation process involves feeding the validation images into the trained model and calculating the loss and accuracy metrics. The evaluation results provide insights into the model's performance on unseen data.

Results Analysis: The training and validation loss/accuracy curves are plotted using Matplotlib to visualize the model's learning progress and identify any signs of overfitting or underfitting. The curves help determine if the model has learned effectively or if adjustments are needed.

Throughout the project, various technologies like TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, PIL, Matplotlib, and Augmentor are utilized to handle data, construct the model, preprocess images, and visualize results.

The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a reliable and accurate skin cancer classification model that can assist in early detection and diagnosis, contributing to improved patient outcomes and healthcare practices.

Background:
Skin cancer is a prevalent form of cancer globally, and its early detection plays a crucial role in successful treatment. Dermatologists often examine skin lesions visually and make judgments based on their experience. However, this process can be subjective and error-prone. Machine learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown promise in automating the diagnosis of skin cancer by analyzing images of skin lesions.

Business Problem:
The business problem addressed by this project is the need for an accurate and reliable method to classify skin cancer. By developing a CNN model, the aim is to provide a tool that can assist dermatologists in the early detection and diagnosis of skin cancer. This can lead to improved patient outcomes, more timely interventions, and potentially reduce the burden on healthcare systems.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is the "Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM10000" dataset, provided by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). It consists of 10,015 dermatoscopic images, representing different types of skin lesions, including benign and malignant cases. The dataset is organized into nine classes, each corresponding to a specific type of skin cancer. The images are of varying sizes and resolutions.

The dataset is split into a training set and a validation set. Data augmentation techniques are applied to the training set to address class imbalance and enhance model performance. The augmented images are then used for model training, while the original validation images are used for evaluating the model's performance on unseen data.

By training a CNN model on this dataset, the project aims to create a classification system that can accurately identify different types of skin cancer, potentially assisting dermatologists in their diagnosis and improving patient outcomes.

## Conclusions
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise in automating the classification of skin cancer by analyzing dermatoscopic images. The model developed in this project demonstrates the potential to assist dermatologists in the early detection and diagnosis of skin cancer, which can lead to improved patient outcomes.

Data augmentation techniques, such as rotation and flipping, can be applied to address class imbalance and enhance the performance of the CNN model. By augmenting the training data, the model becomes more robust and capable of handling variations in the input images.

Training a CNN model for a sufficient number of epochs is crucial to achieve optimal performance. The model's accuracy and validation accuracy tend to increase as the number of epochs increases, indicating that the model continues to learn and improve its predictions over time.

Evaluating the model's performance using a separate validation dataset helps assess its generalization ability. The validation accuracy provides an indication of how well the model performs on unseen data, which is essential for real-world applications. Regular monitoring of the model's validation accuracy is necessary to detect signs of overfitting or underfitting and make necessary adjustments to ensure optimal performance.
